\b Project S.A.G.A.R. — Page Features, User Impact, and Future Roadmap\b0\par
\par
\b Overview\b0\par
- This report catalogs key features implemented across pages, their intended user impact, and high‑value future enhancements.\par
\par
\b Home (frontend/src/pages/Home.jsx)\b0\par
- Features:\par
  - Global navigation via Navbar; hero section with animated ocean background (Three.js) and live stats ticker; capability cards; footer; VARUN AI assistant toggle.\par
  - Components: Navbar, Hero, Features, Footer, VarunAIAgent.\par
- User Impact:\par
  - Clear orientation and brand presence; high visual engagement; fast paths to core areas; immediate access to AI help.\par
- Future Ideas:\par
  - Personalized hero/CTAs based on user role; deep-link prompts that open VARUN with page-context; i18n; performance budget for 3D background with fallback on low-end devices; A/B test feature card order.\par
\par
\b AI Analytics (frontend/src/pages/AIAnalyticsPage.jsx)\b0\par
- Features:\par
  - Multi-agent UI (Varun, Team Lead, Deep Search, Compliance, DB Manager, Analytics); quick actions; simulated voice toggle; system metrics; Recharts visualizations; reasoning toggle.\par
  - Tech: lucide-react icons; recharts; stateful conversation; mock MCP/system layer.\par
- User Impact:\par
  - Natural language entry point to analytics; transparency via reasoning; rapid access to common queries; confidence via system status.\par
- Future Ideas:\par
  - Real speech-to-text/text-to-speech; streaming responses; RAG over actual datasets; agent handoff visual timelines; export chats to report; auth + per-user history; accessibility (ARIA/live regions).\par
\par
\b Data Portal (frontend/src/pages/DataPortal.jsx)\b0\par
- Features:\par
  - Unified data browsing (filters, sorting, search, time range, quality), bulk actions/downloads, stats, and VARUN integration. (Note: current code is commented/mocked.)\par
- User Impact:\par
  - One place to explore and extract datasets; reduces tool-switching; supports QA workflows.\par
- Future Ideas:\par
  - Enable the view with real APIs; virtualized tables for large data; provenance and quality badges; saved views; role-based access; signed download links; dataset citations.\par
\par
\b Oceanographic Portal (frontend/src/pages/OceanographicPortal.jsx)\b0\par
- Features:\par
  - Parameter/region/depth/time filters; station list and metrics; D3 charts (temperature/salinity profiles, time series); simulated real-time streaming.\par
- User Impact:\par
  - Faster situational awareness on ocean conditions; supports exploratory analysis and QA.\par
- Future Ideas:\par
  - Map integration (Leaflet/Mapbox) with layers; interactive cross-filtering; compare periods; anomaly flags; CSV/NetCDF export; shareable permalinks; keyboard navigation.\par
\par
\b Fisheries Portal (frontend/src/pages/FisheriesPortal.jsx)\b0\par
- Features:\par
  - Vessel registry and status; catch records with scientific attributes; analysis modes; filters; tracking and compliance indicators; VARUN integration.\par
- User Impact:\par
  - Operational picture for managers; supports sustainability decisions (quota/utilization, alerts).\par
- Future Ideas:\par
  - Live AIS/VMS feeds; geofencing + rules engine; photo-based AI species ID; enforcement workflows; multilingual UI; offline field mode and sync.\par
\par
\b eDNA Portal (frontend/src/pages/EDNAportal.jsx)\b0\par
- Features:\par
  - eDNA sample inventory; species DB; D3 phylogenetic tree; biodiversity metrics; sequence visualization; filters; VARUN integration.\par
- User Impact:\par
  - Accelerates biodiversity insight generation; makes molecular outputs explorable/communicable.\par
- Future Ideas:\par
  - Pipeline integration (QC, demultiplexing, BLAST); MIxS metadata validation; export FASTA/CSV; link to OBIS/GBIF; reproducible reports and DOIs.\par
\par
\b Marine Digital Twin (frontend/src/pages/MarineDigitalTwinPlatform.jsx)\b0\par
- Features:\par
  - Interactive map (Leaflet via CDN) with environmental overlays (temperature, chlorophyll, currents); tracked entities (e.g., whale sharks) with movement history; Recharts time-series; controls for layers and playback.\par
- User Impact:\par
  - Spatial situational awareness; intuitive exploration of model/state; supports communication with stakeholders.\par
- Future Ideas:\par
  - Offline map tiles; 3D globe via deck.gl/Kepler.gl; model coupling (ROMS/biogeochemical); scenario save/share; annotations and collaboration; mobile-friendly controls.\par
\par
\b Shared Components\b0\par
- Navbar (frontend/src/components/Navbar.jsx): sticky header, scroll-aware styling, desktop/mobile nav, quick access to core sections.\par
- Hero (frontend/src/components/Hero.jsx): animated Three.js ocean background via Ocean component, rotating stats ticker, trusted-by section.\par
- Features (frontend/src/components/Features.jsx): animated capability cards with staggered entrance and gradients.\par
- Footer (frontend/src/components/Footer.jsx): platform links, contact, stats, and animated accents.\par
- Ocean (frontend/src/components/Ocean.jsx): Three.js water shader with performance-aware resize and cleanup.\par
- VarunAIAgent (frontend/src/components/VarunAIAgent.jsx): docked/toggleable assistant with context-aware welcome, quick actions, simulated voice/tts, and chat history.\par
\par
\b Cross-Page Future Enhancements\b0\par
- Performance: code-splitting per route; lazy-load heavy libs (Three.js, D3); skeletons; image optimization.\par
- Accessibility: roles/labels, focus management, high-contrast mode, keyboard-first nav.\par
- Internationalization: i18n with locale switching; RTL support where applicable.\par
- Observability: client telemetry for feature usage; error boundaries with user-friendly recovery.\par
- Security: authZ per dataset; audit logs; CSP and dependency scanning.\par
- PWA/Offline: installable app; caching for maps/tables; background sync for uploads.\par
- Collaboration: annotations, shareable deep links with state, export to PDF/Doc.\par
\par
\b Notes\b0\par
- Some pages contain mocked or commented code blocks intended as placeholders until backend services are connected; recommendations above assume live data integration.\par
